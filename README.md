## API Reference

### Core Classes

#### `NearRewardsClient`
Main client for interacting with NEAR blockchain:

```typescript
// Initialize client with failover RPC providers
const client = new NearRewardsClient();

// Get native balance (supports historical queries)
const balance = await client.getNativeBalance(accountId, blockHeight?);

// Check if account is a contract
const isContract = await client.isContract(accountId);

// Get lockup contract information
const lockedAmount = await client.getLockedAmount(accountId);
const liquidBalance = await client.getLiquidOwnersBalance(accountId);
```

### Utility Functions

#### Balance Formatting
```typescript
// Convert yoctoNEAR to NEAR (rounded to 2 decimals)
const nearAmount = getNearAmount(yoctoBalance);

// Format USD values
const usdValue = formatUSD(nearAmount, nearPrice);
```

#### Price & Epoch Information
```typescript
// Get current NEAR price
const price = await fetchNearPrice();

// Calculate epoch progress
const progress = calculateCurrentPositionInEpoch(epochStart, currentHeight);
```

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies
- **@near-js/accounts**: Account management and balance queries
- **@near-js/providers**: RPC provider with failover support
- **@near-js/utils**: Official NEAR formatting utilities
- **@near-js/types**: TypeScript type definitions
- **@raycast/api**: Raycast extension framework

### RPC Endpoints
The extension uses multiple RPC endpoints for reliability:
- `https://free.rpc.fastnear.com` (Primary)
- `https://rpc.mainnet.near.org` (Fallback)
- `https://1rpc.io/near` (Fallback)
- `https://near.lava.build` (Fallback)

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of contract method calls on regular accounts
- Automatic fallback between RPC providers
- User-friendly error messages for invalid accounts
